    <p>Discovered in July 1799 during Napoleon’s Egyptian campaign, the Rosetta Stone is a broken granodiorite slab that once stood in a temple near the Nile‑delta town of Rashid (Rosetta). French engineers found it reused as building material for Fort Julien; two years later, it was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Alexandria and has been exhibited in the British Museum since 1802.</p>
    <p>The stone records a decree issued at Memphis in 196 BCE to celebrate the coronation of the 13‑year‑old Ptolemy V. To ensure the message reached every audience, priests ordered the text to appear in three scripts: hieroglyphic for sacred purposes, Demotic for everyday administration, and Ancient Greek for the ruling elite. Although only the lower two‑thirds survives, enough parallel phrases remain to show the decree is virtually identical across the three versions.</p>
    <p>Because scholars could already read Greek, the inscription provided a direct bilingual—or, more accurately, tri‑lingual—comparison. In 1814, Thomas Young identified Demotic signs that spelled out royal names, establishing that Egyptian scripts could represent sounds. Building on Young’s work, Jean‑François Champollion announced in 1822 that hieroglyphs combined phonetic and pictorial elements, unlocking three millennia of previously unread Egyptian texts and giving birth to modern Egyptology.</p>
    <p>The stone also shaped the broader history of writing. By proving that apparently pictorial scripts could encode sound values, it encouraged linguists to look for phonetic principles in other undeciphered scripts, influencing later successes with cuneiform, Linear B, and, much later, Maya glyphs. Its three‑script inscription illustrates how political authority in the Hellenistic world addressed multiple language communities, highlighting the practical need for multilingual communication in antiquity.</p>
    <p>Today the Rosetta Stone remains a critical reference for script study and a symbol of how comparative analysis can unlock the meaning of lost writing systems, reminding visitors that decipherment is a cornerstone of understanding past civilizations.</p>

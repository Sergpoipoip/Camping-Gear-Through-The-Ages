    <p>This mysterious slab of finely polished black basalt, inscribed with hieroglyphs in orderly rows, is one of the very earliest attempts of mankind to document history systematically. Dating from Egypt's Fifth Dynasty (c. 2400 BCE), the Palermo Stone was a portion of a larger stele that originally documented the reigns of Egypt's earliest kings, from the mythical pre-dynastic kings to the pharaohs of the Old Kingdom. Its inscriptions — a detailed chronicle of annual events, Nile flood heights, religious rituals, and campaigns — are revealing of how ancient Egyptians incorporated administration, faith, and remembrance into a single object.</p>
    <p>The Palermo Stone is twice historically significant. First, it revolutionized Egyptology: its fragmentary but comprehensive annals provided scholars with a chronological framework for early Egyptian history, years before the Rosetta Stone deciphered hieroglyphic writing. Second, it is a milestone in the evolution of writing itself. Unlike temple reliefs or tomb inscriptions, this stele demonstrates writing's role as an agent of statecraft — recording taxes, crops, and royal deeds to justify power and secure cosmic order (ma'at).</p>
    <p>Discovered in the 19th century with no documented archaeological background, its origin remains contentious. Yet its preservation bears witness to the durability of basalt and the sophistication of Egyptian scribal practice.</p>

    <p>Stamped with a jar, a human head and clusters of wedge marks, this palm‑sized clay tablet captures a day in the life of an ancient city.</p>
    <p>It records the allocation of beer — the Sumerian staple and wage — to labourers building temples in late‑Uruk Mesopotamia. The jar pictogram (KAŠ) signifies beer, the human head denotes ration, while abstract wedge clusters denote numbers. Though its symbols are still pictorial, their arrangement follows a grid that foreshadows full cuneiform script. Such administrative tablets proliferated as temple economies grew, forcing scribes to streamline drawing into linear strokes impressed with a reed stylus. Within a few centuries the pictures morphed into abstract wedges and the world’s first true writing was born.</p>
    <p>Thus this modest “pay slip” is more than evidence of ancient payroll; it is a snapshot of writing in transition, driven by bureaucracy, beer and the need to count.</p>

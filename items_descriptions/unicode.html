    <p>Every tweet, emoji, or multi-language website owes a debt to this pair of grey-and-teal manuals: The Unicode Standard, Version 1.0. Printed by Addison-Wesley in 1991 and 1992, the volumes catalogued 7,129 characters — from Latin A and Greek Ω to Bengali আ and Tibetan ཀ — each assigned an unchanging hexadecimal number.</p>
    <p>Before Unicode, computers juggled hundreds of incompatible “code pages”; the same byte that meant “é” in Paris displayed as “ф” in Moscow. Engineers Joe Becker, Lee Collins, and Mark Davis founded the Unicode Consortium to stop the confusion, arguing that one 16-bit space (65,536 slots) could hold the world’s living scripts. Volume 1 set out the architecture and the alphabetic, syllabic, and symbol blocks; Volume 2 followed with the first 20,902 unified Han ideographs, proving that massive character repertoires could also fit.</p>
    <p>The books are hybrids — part scholarly code chart, part programmer’s handbook — and they mark a pivotal extension of writing history: the migration from page and stone onto the silicon screen. By giving every character, ancient or modern, a place in memory, Unicode transformed global publishing, databases, smartphones, and social media. Its living successors now encode more than 150,000 signs, yet the conceptual leap began here, on these printed pages, where humanity’s scripts first shared a single, universal address book.</p>

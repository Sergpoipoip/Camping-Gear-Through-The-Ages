    <p>Charred black yet gleaming with ideas, the **Derveni Papyrus** is Europe’s oldest surviving manuscript. Discovered in 1962 amid the ashes of a nobleman’s funeral pyre at Derveni, Macedonia, the 266 fragments you see here once formed a papyrus roll copied around 340 BCE, during the reign of Philip II of Macedon.</p>
    <p>The flames that consumed the grave goods carbonised the scroll, sealing it against Greece’s humid soil and allowing it to outlive millennia.</p>
    <p>Written in elegant Attic‑Ionic Greek, the text offers an allegorical reading of an Orphic poem describing the birth of the gods, freely blending mythology with the rational physics of Pre‑Socratic thinkers.</p>
    <p>Here we glimpse a pivotal moment when Greek scholars began to set oral tradition onto portable pages, inventing literary criticism as they wrote.</p>
    <p>Because papyrus was pricey and fragile, Greek “books” rarely survive outside Egypt; this lone roll proves that Macedonian elites owned and valued written texts well before Alexander’s conquests spread Hellenic letters eastward. Painstakingly read with infrared and multispectral imaging, the papyrus continues to yield new lines and new questions.</p>
    <p>In 2015 UNESCO placed the Derveni Papyrus on its *Memory of the World* register, recognising a document that unites myth, philosophy and the very craft of writing at the threshold of the Western book.</p>

    <p>This small shard of baboon fibula, polished by ancient hands and tipped with a piece of quartz, may look unassuming, yet it preserves one of humanity’s oldest dialogues with number and symbol.</p>
    <p>Discovered in 1950 on the shores of Lake Edward, the bone bears three neat columns of 168 incised notches, deliberately grouped into sequences of 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 12. To many scholars these clusters echo doubling, halving and prime‑number sets — evidence that Ice‑Age hunter‑gatherers already manipulated abstract quantities tens of millennia before agriculture or bronze. Whether tally of lunar days, trading ledger, or ritual calendar, the Ishango Bone demonstrates the cognitive leap from merely recording physical objects to marking ideas in material form.</p>
    <p>Though not “writing” in the strict sense, its scratched signs anticipate the concept that thoughts can outlive the thinker when fixed in a medium. In that insight lies the germ of every later script, from Mesopotamian cuneiform to today’s digital code.</p>

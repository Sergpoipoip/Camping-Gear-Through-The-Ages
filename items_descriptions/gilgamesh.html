    <p>This 7th-century BCE clay tablet, inscribed with wedge-shaped cuneiform characters, is one of the most outstanding examples of Mesopotamian art. It was discovered in the ruins of the Library of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh (modern-day Iraq), a repository of learning gathered by the last great king of the Assyrians. The tablet has a portion of the Epic of Gilgamesh, the world's oldest surviving complete epic, and recounts a moment of turning: the Mesopotamian Flood story, in which the gods bring a devastating flood to destroy humanity.</p>
    <p>The historical significance of the tablet cannot be exaggerated. When deciphered in 1872 by British Museum curator George Smith, its parallel with the biblical story of Noah's Ark caused a worldwide sensation. Scholars were confronted for the first time with a pre-biblical version showing striking similarities with Genesis, raising questions about the uniqueness of scriptural records and stirring debates over shared cultural traditions in ancient Near Eastern societies.</p>
    <p>Beyond its literary stature, the tablet offers hints at intellectual life in Assyria. Its survival attests to the durability of baked clay as a writing medium and the sophistication culture of Mesopotamian scribes. The dense cuneiform writing, inscribed into the clay with a reed stylus, displays meticulous craftsmanship, and the story itself—a drama of divine wrath, survival, and moral reckoning—betray universal human interest in the human condition and its position within nature and the divine.</p>

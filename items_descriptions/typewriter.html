    <p>Glossy black lacquer, gold garlands and a treadle borrowed from a sewing machine make this Remington No. 1 look more like parlor furniture than high tech — but in 1874 it was revolutionary. Inventors Christopher Sholes and Carlos Glidden had spent seven hard years transforming a page-numbering gizmo into a full alphabetic “Type-Writer”. When gun-maker E. Remington & Sons agreed to mass-produce it at their Ilion, New York works, writing jumped from ink to iron.</p>
    <p>The machine’s four-row QWERTY keyboard (devised to reduce jammed typebars) became the world’s default layout, still printed on every phone and laptop. Although early models could strike only capital letters and hid the typing from the operator, they cut business correspondence time in half and produced legible, carbon-copy texts that longhand could not match.</p>
    <p>Typewriters quickly populated counting-houses and law offices, and with them came a new labor force: women trained as “type-writers,” earning independent wages and redefining office culture. By the 1890s dozens of rivals chased Remington, but every machine — mechanical, electric or digital — owes a debt to this ornate pioneer. Its clackety keys mechanised the act of writing, bridged print and computing, and sounded the first taps of the information age.</p>

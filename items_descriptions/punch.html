    <p>This stiff cardboard rectangle, the size of a dollar bill, is perforated with rows and columns of tiny rectangular holes.</p>
    <p>Each position corresponds to a demographic fact—sex, age, marital status—encoded by punching or leaving blank. Inventor Herman Hollerith devised the card to mechanise the United States Census of 1890, which threatened to overwhelm traditional clerks. His electric tabulators sensed the holes with spring‑loaded pins, completing tallies in months instead of years and saving the government millions. The punch card became the universal medium of data for the next eight decades, feeding textile looms, train timetables and, eventually, mainframe computers.</p>
    <p>In reducing categories of human experience to binary choices, Hollerith anticipated the logic of digital information.</p>

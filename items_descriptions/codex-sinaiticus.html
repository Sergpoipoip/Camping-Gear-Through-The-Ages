    <p>Black‑ink uncials march across four neat columns on creamy parchment: this is **Codex Sinaiticus**, the oldest surviving Bible in book form. Written in Greek around the mid‑fourth century, the codex originally contained some 730 parchment leaves — enough to hold the whole Septuagint, the entire New Testament, and two early Christian works later judged non‑canonical.:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} Its makers pioneered large‑format book engineering: thin, high‑quality vellum, careful ruling, and sturdy quires allowed what had once been a chest of scrolls to become a single, portable volume.</p>
    <p>The manuscript lay in the remote library of St Catherine’s Monastery until 1844, when the German scholar Constantin von Tischendorf glimpsed its antiquity and launched a dramatic, decades‑long quest to study and publish it. Today its pages are divided among London, Leipzig, St Petersburg, and Sinai, with additional fragments unearthed in a sealed storeroom in 1975.</p>
    <p>Codex Sinaiticus is more than an archaeological treasure; thousands of ancient corrections in its margins chart the evolving Bible and the hands of generations who revered — and revised — its text. Modern scholars still consult its readings for every critical edition of scripture, while its massive, four‑column pages testify that the codex could eclipse the scroll and reshape how the written word was packaged, read, and shared. In doing so, it helped lay the technological groundwork for the book as we know it.</p>

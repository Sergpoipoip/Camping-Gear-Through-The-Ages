    <p>The Gutenberg Bible was the first major book printed in Europe with massproduced movable metal type.</p>
    <p>Bound in calfskin and illuminated by hand, this Bible looks like a medieval manuscript until you notice the astonishing regularity of its letters. Johann Gutenberg’s press used some 290 unique characters — letters, ligatures, punctuation — each cast from a matrix and alloy specially formulated to flow and harden fast. Printed on paper and vellum in two columns of 42 lines, the edition of about 180 copies sold out before completion. The Bible marks the moment when text became a commodity reproducible in thousands rather than painstaking single copies. Prices of books plummeted; pamphlets, newspapers and pocket almanacs followed. Within 50 years, presses had spread to every major European city, fuelling the Renaissance, Reformation and Scientific Revolution.</p>
    <p>The Gutenberg Bible thus represents not only a triumph of engineering and typography but the dawn of the Information Age.</p>

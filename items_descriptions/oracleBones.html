    <p>These cracked and weathered fragments of turtle shell and ox bone, bearing straight-line symbols, are the first glimpse into the origin of Chinese writing by humanity. Between approximately 1250 and 1050 BCE, in the Shang Dynasty, the Oracle Bone Inscriptions, or Jiaguwen, were divination tools used for communication with ancestors and gods. Kings and diviners posed questions about harvests, wars, and ritual, then wrote out their questions on the bone with bronze knives. Heat was used until cracks appeared, and the cracks were "read" as divine answers — a divine dialogue inscribed in permanence.</p>
    <p>They are historically revolutionary inscriptions. They document the oldest known Chinese writing, with over 4,000 deciphered characters, many of which can be identified as ancestors of the contemporary Chinese logograms. Their discovery in 1899 at Yinxu (modern Anyang) confirmed the existence of the Shang Dynasty, previously considered mythical, and uncovered a highly developed bureaucracy based on written documents.</p>
    <p>For writing to develop, Oracle Bones mark a big leap from symbols to an institutionalized system capable of documenting refined ideas. Compared to other proto-writing, these inscriptions disclose syntax, grammar, and systematic correspondence between sound and meaning — pillars of true literacy. The meticulous craftsmanship of Shang scribes, who transmuted ritual practice into enduring text, accentuates writing's dual role as both religious medium and administrative device.</p>

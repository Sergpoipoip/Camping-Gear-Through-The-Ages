    <p>Thin as a postcard yet packed with information, this clay tablet lists bronze tripods destined for a palace storeroom.</p>
    <p>The scribe wrote with a stylus while the clay was damp; an accidental fire that destroyed the Palace of Nestor baked the tablet, preserving it for 3,200 years. Its script—Linear B—uses around 90 syllabic signs and dozens of ideograms. When Michael Ventris deciphered the script in 1952, linking signs to early Greek, this very tablet confirmed his reading: TI‑RI‑PO‑DE, tri‑podes, “tripods”. The discovery revolutionised Aegean archaeology, proving that the Mycenaeans, not later Greeks, kept written bureaucratic records and that syllabic writing could faithfully encode an Indo‑European language.</p>
    <p>The tablet shows how writing travels: adapted from Minoan Linear A, which itself remains undeciphered, Linear B demonstrates that scripts can be borrowed and reshaped to serve new tongues and administrations.</p>

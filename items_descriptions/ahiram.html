    <p>The sarcophagus of King Ahiram bears one of the earliest known fully alphabetic inscriptions in Phoenician.</p>
    <p>Carved from limestone, the coffin of Ahiram, ruler of the Phoenician city‑state of Byblos, carries a 38‑word curse: "May anyone who opens this sarcophagus be stripped of power and buried far from his ancestors…" The text is written in early Phoenician, the oldest fully developed alphabet. Each letter represents a single consonantal sound: b, g, d, and so on — 22 characters that liberated writing from the hundreds of symbols needed in cuneiform or hieroglyphics. Traders and sailors carried this economical script around the Mediterranean, where Greeks added vowels, Etruscans adapted it for Latin, and the genetic line of most modern alphabets began.</p>
    <p>The Ahiram inscription thus captures the tipping point where writing became truly portable, easy to learn and ready to fuel the spread of literacy, commerce and ideas.</p>

    <p>This slender anthology of Zen Buddhist teachings carries a quiet superlative: it is the oldest surviving book printed with movable metal type.</p>
    <p>Crafted at Heungdeok Temple in 1377—78 years before Gutenberg’s Bible—the book demonstrates Korea’s mastery of casting individual characters from bronze, assembling them into a forme, and printing crisp pages on mulberry paper. Only the second volume remains, yet its 28 chapters reveal a mature technology: even spacing, clear ink, and corrections achieved simply by swapping a type piece. Korean printers developed movable type to satisfy the state examination system’s appetite for textbooks, proving that administrative pressure, as much as religion, can spark innovation. Jikji links the artisanal world of woodblock printing to the industrial logic of mechanised type: text no longer carved but composed, disassembled, reused.</p>
    <p>Its story reminds us that the road to modern literacy passed through many workshops—and that some of its milestones lie east of Mainz.</p>

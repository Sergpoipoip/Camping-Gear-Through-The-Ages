    <p>Unrolling more than five metres, this gray‑blue scroll begins with an elegant woodcut of the Buddha teaching.</p>
    <p>A colophon at the end dates it to the “thirteenth day of the fourth moon of the ninth year of Xiantong” (11 May 868) and names the donor, Wang Jie. That single line makes the Diamond Sūtra the world’s earliest dated, fully printed book. Each sheet was carved in reverse on wooden blocks, inked and pressed onto paper, then pasted edge‑to‑edge. The precision of the characters and the speed implicit in their reproduction illustrate a technological leap: knowledge detached from the slow hand of the scribe. Buddhist monasteries used printing to scatter sutras like spiritual seeds across East Asia.</p>
    <p>The idea would later travel via the Silk Road and be reinvented in Europe, but here, in the desert cave of Dunhuang, we witness print culture already in full flower.</p>
